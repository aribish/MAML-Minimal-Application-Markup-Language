# MAML Minimal Application Markup Language
A simple markup language used to make presentation-style desktop applications

Thanks for checking out MAML! This repository contains the MAML parser program, some documentation and references, and some sample MAML programs.

Feel free to check out the source code, but beware, as there aren't too many comments right now and the code looks just awful.

ALSO! As of right now, the MAML Parser Program can only run on Unix-based operating systems. At some point, I'll probably release a Windows version though, so yuh.

## Compile MAML
If you'd like to compile MAML, just use the Makefile included. If you've never used Make and Makefiles before, just open the terminal, set your current directory to the MAML source code and use the command "make maml." That's it!

## PLEASE READ (3/13/22)
This repo is getting redone! The file structure and source code is being rewritten. I'm in the middle of looking back at my past projects and realizing their flaws. The program SHOULD work right now, but it kinda sucks ngl.

Expect a new repo name, new file structure, and a new syntax.
