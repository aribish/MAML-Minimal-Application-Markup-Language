# MAML Minimal Application Markup Language
A simple markup language used to make presentation-style desktop applications

<hr>

## Compile MAML
To compile MAML, run `make maml` in your shell. MAML's only dependency is SFML. To install this, run `sudo pacman -S sfml` on Arch Linux and its distributions or `sudo apt install libsfml-dev` on Debian or its derivitives.

## PLEASE READ (3/13/22)
This repo is getting redone! The file structure and source code is being rewritten. I'm in the middle of looking back at my past projects and realizing their flaws. The program SHOULD work right now, but it kinda sucks ngl.

Expect a new repo name, new file structure, and a new syntax.
