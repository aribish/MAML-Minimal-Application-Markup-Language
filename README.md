# MAML Minimal Application Markup Language
A simple markup language used to make presentation-style desktop applications

Thanks for checking out MAML! This repository contains the MAML parser program, some documentation and references, and some sample MAML programs.

Feel free to check out the source code, but beware, as there aren't too many comments right now and the code looks just awful.

ALSO! As of right now, the MAML Parser Program can only run on Unix-based operating systems. At some point, I'll probably release a Windows version, though, so yuh.

Dope.
